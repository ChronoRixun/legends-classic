# lcsave: the LC save format and the old-save converter (reference implementation)

What it is: the builder's reference implementation of the new save container ("LC save", format 1) and of the
one-time converter from XMen2.exe's own save format, plus the era model that tells which builder release numbered
an old save's positional data. XML2 Fix carries the C++ translation; this package is the oracle it is checked
against (decision D1 of the save-format pass).

Nothing in this package or its data carries game content: `data/catalogue.json` and `data/legacy_eras.json` hold
SHA-256 hashes of canonical keys and position numbers only. Names come from the player's own build at run time.

    python -m lcsave convert  OLD.save OUT.lcsave --build BUILD_DIR [--slot N] [--report out.json]
    python -m lcsave dump     FILE [--build BUILD_DIR] [--out dump.json]      # old or new save -> canonical JSON
    python -m lcsave verify   OLD.save --build BUILD_DIR [--out DIR]           # convert, dump both, reverse, compare
    python -m lcsave corpus   FOLDER --build BUILD_DIR --out DIR               # every saveslot*.save under FOLDER
    python -m lcsave eras     --reference BUILD --era CV=BUILD ...             # developer: regenerate the era model
    python -m lcsave catalogue --build BUILD [--eras data/legacy_eras.json]   # developer: regenerate the catalogue

Modules: `keys` (domains, canonical key hash, id grammar, CRC-32), `layout` (table-driven byte layouts of the old
save and the new container), `oldsave` (bounds-checked reader / writer), `binds` (the engine's numbering of a
build's data, the placed-entity ordinal rule), `catalogue`, `legacy` (era model and detection), `container`
(sections, records, validation), `convert` (old -> new, the reverse reader, the verification commands), `dump`.

Tests: `python tests/unit/run.py -k test_lcsave` (invented build and saves). Specification: the save-format pass
documents (SPEC-new-save revision 2.3, SPEC-old-save revision 2.1) in the coordinator's notes; the port design for
XML2 Fix is CONVERTER-PORT.md beside them.
